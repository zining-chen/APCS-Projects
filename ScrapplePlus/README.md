This is a game of Scrapple with the computer.
<br>
The rules are with basic Scrabble, although it lacks a board.<br>
Using the same letter two times in a row gives double word score.<br>
The previous Scrabble word gives extra score if it starts with the 
same letter as the previous word.

The program uses the WordUtilitiesPlus Resource found in the Resources folder.
